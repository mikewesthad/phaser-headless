# Phaser Headless

A simple demo of how to use [Phaser 3](http://phaser.io/) in headless mode using [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). This allows you to run the game engine in node and may be useful for automated testing or game servers. See [index.js](./index.js).

## Installation

Make sure you have a recent version of node installed and then run:

```
npm install
```

## Running

After installing, run the following and you'll see the game running in your console:

```
npm run start
```
